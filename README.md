# Description

My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio of my current completed projects, this is so I can update it later on with future projects.
This project was more challenging than I expected and took a couple of do-overs to complete.

# Installation

1: Download repository from github 2: Save it where desired 3: Open the file using a text editor of your choice

If it's the website you wish to access rather than the source code follow these instructions instead:

1: Copy link provided along with this repository.

# Usage

The links at the top of the page will take you to various places on the webpage. Also selecting the individual projects will link you to them in a new tab (unless they are placeholders). Finally the github link at the bottom takes you to my github page.
